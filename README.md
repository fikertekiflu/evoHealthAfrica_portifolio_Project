# **EvoHealthAfrica**

## **Introduction**
EvoHealthAfrica is an educational platform designed to raise awareness about HIV, malaria, and monkeypox. In addition to educational content, the platform integrates machine learning models for predicting diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease. Users can input their health data and receive predictions on potential health risks, thereby allowing for early intervention and better health management.

Usage
Running the Application:
After installing the dependencies, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:3000** to access the app.

The homepage offers educational content on HIV, malaria, and monkeypox. For disease predictions, go to the relevant sections to enter health data for diabetes, Parkinson's, and heart disease.

Key Features:
Educational Resources: Detailed sections on HIV, malaria, and monkeypox to inform users about the symptoms, prevention, and treatment.
Disease Prediction: Users can enter their health data and receive predictive insights using machine learning models for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s.
